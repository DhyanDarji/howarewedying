# How are we dying
A data visualisation and analysis project done using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

Contains:
  the PowerPoint file which I presented that has all the graphs.
  World map file that could not be implemented on the PowerPoint (due to its interactive nature).
  Jupyter Notebook file that contains all the coding that took place for the Project.
